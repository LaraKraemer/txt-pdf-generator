# txt-pdf Generator
This is another project from my python bootcamp where I build a pdf file. As a data source I work with four .txt files. This exercise will further practise my for-loops
skills. 

## How to work with this repository
1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure you have the latest Python version. I worked with 3.12.
3. Open Project: `cd myproject`
4. Install venv: `python3 -m venv venv`
5. Run venv: `source venv/bin/activate`
6. Add: `yourfile.txt files`
7. Write more code, write the tests, and have fun! ðŸŽ‰
